# ✅ YeboVerify Setup Complete

The YeboVerify KYC Android app has been successfully implemented and configured. All critical issues have been resolved.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### ✅ Android Configuration Issues - RESOLVED

#### NDK Version Conflict
**Issue**: Multiple plugins required Android NDK 27.0.12077973 but project used 26.3.11579264
**Fix**: Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to use NDK version "27.0.12077973"

#### Minimum SDK Version
**Issue**: Camera plugin (camera_android_camerax) requires minimum SDK 23
**Fix**: Updated minimum SDK version from flutter.minSdkVersion to 23

```kotlin
android {
    ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 23  // Required for camera plugins
    }
}
```

**Impact**: App now requires Android 6.0+ (API level 23) but gains full camera functionality

### ✅ Required Permissions - ADDED
Added all necessary permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- Camera access for ID and selfie capture
- Storage permissions for temporary files
- Internet and network access for API calls
- Biometric and fingerprint permissions
- USB permissions for external fingerprint readers

### ✅ Import and Compilation Issues - FIXED
- Added missing Flutter Material imports to services and controllers
- Fixed GetX reactive property access patterns
- Resolved CardTheme compatibility issues
- Updated theme file location and structure

## 🏗️ App Architecture Summary

### Complete Flutter App with GetX
- **8 Main Pages**: Splash, Onboarding, Home, Verification Flow, ID Capture, Selfie, Fingerprint, Results
- **6 Core Services**: Storage, API, Camera, OCR, Biometric, Fingerprint
- **Security Features**: AES-256 encryption, secure storage, template-based biometrics
- **Offline Capability**: Data capture works without internet connection

### KYC Verification Flow
1. **Splash** → App initialization and permissions
2. **Onboarding** → Feature introduction
3. **Home** → Main dashboard
4. **Verification Flow** → Step-by-step wizard
5. **ID Capture** → Document scanning with quality checks
6. **Selfie** → Face detection and liveness checks
7. **Fingerprint** → Multiple finger capture with deduplication
8. **Results** → Verification outcome and next steps

## 🚀 Ready to Use

### ✅ Build Status: SUCCESS
- All critical compilation errors resolved
- Android build completes successfully (exit code 0)
- No NDK version conflicts
- All required permissions configured

### 🎯 Next Steps
1. **Run the app**: `flutter run` from project directory
2. **Connect hardware**: Integrate real fingerprint readers
3. **API Backend**: Implement server-side verification
4. **Testing**: Device testing and accuracy validation
5. **Deployment**: Prepare for Play Store release

## 📱 Hardware Requirements
- **Android Device**: API level 23+ (Android 6.0+) - Required for camera functionality
- **Camera**: Required for ID and selfie capture
- **Fingerprint Reader**: External USB/serial reader (optional)
- **Storage**: Minimum 100MB free space
- **Network**: Internet for verification processing

## 🔐 Security Implementation
- **Template Storage**: Only biometric templates stored, no raw images
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Deduplication**: Fingerprint matching prevents duplicate registrations
- **Quality Checks**: Real-time validation for all captured data
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance

## 📊 Current Implementation Status
